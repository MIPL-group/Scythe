      <section>
        <p>This page hosts the artifact for our PLDI 2017 paper, <a href="writeup/scythe-pldi-draft.pdf"><i>Synthesizing Highly Expressive SQL Queries (draft)</i></a>.
        </p>
       
        <h2>Materials</h2>

        <p>Our artifact <a class='small_link' href="scythe_artifact.tar.gz">[scythe_artifact.tar.gz]</a> contains the following materials: </p>

          <ul> 
            <li> <i>Query-by-example benchmarks</i>, collected from Stack Overflow and previous works.</li>
            <li> <i>Scythe</i>, a programming-by-example system for SQL implemented in Java.</li>
            <li> <i>Evaluation log and plotting scripts</i> used in our paper evaluation.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Benchmarks</h2>
        <p>Our benchmarks (in total 193) can be found in the <code>benchmark/</code> folder of the artifact file, including the following four different sets (as claimed in Section 6.2 of our paper):<p>
        <ul><li><code>dev_set/</code>: 53 Stack Overflow posts collected during our tool development time.</li>
            <li><code>recent_posts/</code>: 51 Stack Overflow posts collected between 2016-10-09 and 2016-10-23.</li>
            <li><code>top_posts/</code>: 51 Stack Overflow posts with votes greater than 30.</li>
            <li><code>sqlsynthesizer/</code>: 28 benchmarks used in previous work, SQLSynthesizer.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Benchmark format:</b> A benchmark file <a href='https://github.com/Mestway/Scythe/blob/pldi-snapshot/data/recent_posts/045' class='small_link'>[example]</a> contains five different segments: link to the original post (if from Stack Overflow), input tables, output table, constraint and reference solutions. Post links and reference solutions are used for documentation purpose, and they are not visible to the tool. </p>

        <ul>
          <li><code>#input/#output</code>: each of these sections contain a table, in either csv (<a class='small_link' href='https://github.com/Mestway/Scythe/blob/pldi-snapshot/data/recent_posts/045'>example</a>) or markdown (<a href='https://github.com/Mestway/Scythe/blob/pldi-snapshot/data/recent_posts/025A' class='small_link'>example</a>) format. There can be than one input sections (for multiple input tables) but only one output section is allowed.</li>
          <li><code>#constraint</code>: this section contains constants and aggregation functions (in JSON format) that will be used in the synthesis process. (As we will show later, aggregation functions won't be used unless you tell the synthesizer, though provided.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Benchmark naming convention:</b> Benchmarks ending with "M" (e.g., <code>dev_set/002M</code>) are those we modified from the original posts in order to rank a correct solution among top 5; benchmarks ending with "A" (e.g., <code>dev_set/039A</code>) are those requiring us to provide aggregation function; benchmarks ending with "X" (e.g. <code>dev_set/032X</code>) are those our tool cannot solve. (Some benchmarks whose solution is not expressible by our tool may contain only a link.)</p>

        <p><b>Tips for creating new example:</b> (1) the example should contain input output example sections, and each section contain exactly one table, and (2) the constraint section is required, and it should contain the <code>constant</code> field (<code>aggregation_functions</code> field is optional).</p>

        <h2>Run Scythe</h2>
        <p>In order to run Scythe, you need to have the file <code>Scythe.jar</code> (included in the artifact) and some example files (e.g., benchmarks) in your computer. Besides, Scythe depends on Java 8 runtime environment; if you don't have it, you can download  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Instruction</h3>
        <p>To run Scythe on a given example, use the following command in your terminal. In this command, <code>example_file</code> refers to the path of your example file, and the option <code>StagedEnumerator</code> refers to our two-phase synthesis algorithm in the paper. In addition, you can replace <code>StagedEnumerator</code> with <code>CanonicalEnumeratorOnTheFly</code> to run the synthesizer with the enumerative search algorithm (the Enum algorithm shown in Section 6 of our paper).</p>
        
        <div>
          <p>Synthesize queries without aggregation constraints:</p>
          <pre>>> java -jar Scythe.jar example_file StagedEnumerator</pre>

          <p>Synthesize queries considering only aggregation functions provided in the constraint sections (this option reduces the search space size as well as increases result ranking):</p>
          <pre>>> java -jar Scythe.jar example_file StagedEnumerator -aggr</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Running the tool on an example file is expected to output a log file recording the search process. At the end of the log, top five synthesized queries are presented.</p>

        <h2>Producing Paper Experiments</h2>
        <p>We introduce how to use our evaluation scripts to reproduce our experiment shown in the paper. The two major experiments that are evaluated with Scythe include (1) the performance of Scythe on the benchmarks compared against Enum (Section 6.4), and (2) algorithm statistics (Section 6.5).</p>

        <h3>Run Experiments</h3>

        <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> In order to run the experiments with our scripts, you need to have <a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/">Python 2.7</a> installed in your computer; if you want to redraw the plots, you also need <a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html">matplot</a> python package.</p>

        <p>Our experiments were run on a quad-core Intel Core i7 2.67GHz CPU with 4GB memory for the Java VM; minor differences are expected when run on different system configuration. The scripts for both running and analysis are included in the <code>eval_scripts/</code> folder.</p>

        <p>Assuming you are in the fold containing the artifact, you should use the following command to run the experiment. The command above will by default run all benchmarks with time limit 600 seconds for each one, and run them with our two-phase algorithm in the paper. To modify the script configuration, directly change declarations in the beginning of the <code>test_benchmarks.py</code> script.</p>

        <pre>>> cd eval_scripts/
>> python test_benchmarks.py</pre>

        <p>Each time you run the script, a new folder containing all logs will created (the initial letter of the log folder is "C" when running with Enum, otherwise it is "S" for Scythe); each file in the folder is a log of running Scythe.jar as shown in the previous section.</p>

        <p><b>Note 1:</b> In order to perform the analysis below, you need to run the scripts with both Scythe and Enum algorithm, which can be configured by commenting (uncommenting) the declaration of the variable <code>synthesis_algorithm</code> at the beginning of the script.</p>

        <p><b>Note 2:</b> Running the script with 'StagedEnumerator' (i.e., our algorithm in the paper) takes ~2 hours. Running the script with 'CanonicalEnumeratorOnTheFly' (i.e., Enum algorithm) takes ~30 hours.</p>

        <p><b>Note 3:</b> The log we used to draw paper plots are provided in the artifact (in the <code>eval_scripts</code> folder): <code>Enum_log</code> and <code>Scythe_log</code>, which can be directly used in analysis.</p>

        <h3>Analyze Experiment Log</h3>

        <p>Once you have the file logs ready, you can launch the analysis using the scripts <code>draw_plot.py</code> and <code>micro_stats.py</code>: the former produces our performance comparison plot in Section 6.4 and the latter calculates the algorithm statistics in Section 6.5.</p> 

        <p><b>Plotting:</b> To produce the performance comparison plot of both algorithm, run the command below (assuming you are in the <code>eval_scripts</code> folder). The two arguments of the script are the folders containing experiment logs: the first one for Scythe algorithm and the second for Enum.</p>
        
        <pre>>> python draw_plots.py Scythe_log/ Enum_log/</pre>

        You are expected to see the plot below after running the plotting script.
        <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="plot.png" style="width:404px; text-align:center;"/></div>

        <p><b>Measure algorithm statistic:</b> To analyze statistics of our algorithm, you need to use the script <code>micro_stats.py</code> with the following two sets of arguments.

        <pre>>> python micro_stats.py Enum_log/ Scythe_log/
>> python micro_stats Scythe_log/</pre>

        <ul>
          <li>The first command compares the number of intermediate results between Scythe and Enum.</li>
          <li>The second one measures (1) the search space reduction rate resulted from pruning away abstract queries that are inconsistent with the output, and (2) the effectiveness of the predicate synthesis algorithm.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The result of the two above commands will produce the statistics we have shown in Section 6.5.</p>
